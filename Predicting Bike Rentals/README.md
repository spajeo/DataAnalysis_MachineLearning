# DataAnalysis


## Sources 

Washington, D.C. is one of the cities having communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. . The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.
Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data into a CSV file, which I'll be working with in this project. You can download the data from the University of California, Irvine's [website]().
